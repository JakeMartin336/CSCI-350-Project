DEADLINE 3: Feel free to submit early for confirmation that you continue on the right track. Upload one zipped
file teamName_3.zip to Gradescope that contains all of the following:
• Player teamName_d3.py for your current tournament player that runs in our environment and makes no
illegal guesses. (If you are wondering, that d is for deadline.)
• Player teamName_B#.py where # is 1, 2, 3, or 4 for your team's baseline player that runs in our environment
and makes no illegal guesses.
• Output (teamName_d3.txt) from 5-7 tournaments where your current tournament player played 100 rounds in
a 5-7 tournament against each of the 13 SCSAs and made no illegal guesses.
• Output (teamName_B#.txt) from 5-7 tournaments where your baseline player played 100 rounds in a 5-7
tournament against each of the 13 SCSAs and made no illegal guesses.
If you are submitting extra baseline players for credit, upload a separate teamName_B#.py and its separate
teamName_B#.txt with your other players to Gradescope. No new baseline players will receive credit after this
date.
