"""
#1: Implement a general-purpose player. Your program should be able to play for any number of pegs and
colors. It should also make reasonable guesses based on the responses it has receive

Functioning baseline player that can play a 4-6 tournament in our environment without illegal guesses.

B1: Exhaustively enumerate all possibilities. Guess each possibility in lexicographic order one at a time, and pay
no attention to the systemâ€™s responses. For example, if pegs p = 4 and colors c = 3, guess AAAA, AAAB, AAAC,
AABA, AABB, AABC and so on. This method will take at most (c^p) guesses.
